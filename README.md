In this notebook, we consider the problem of time series forecasting using DNN, LSTM, and LSTM with CONV1D.
The developed methods are evaluated using Household Electric Power Consumption dataset from Kaggle. The dataset comprises the measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.
